                        For donations, we cannot immediately determine if they are 100% tax-free or not.
                        We need to process the documents first to confirm whether the donation qualifies for tax
                        exemption. Based on the type and nature of the goods, this donation does not qualify. Please
                        refer to the following:

                    <p>
                        Here’s a step-by-step guide to importing donated goods into the Philippines (for either
                        humanitarian, charitable, or non-profit purposes). Because you are active in importation (via
                        your customs brokerage company), I’ll also highlight practical points you’ll want to watch out
                        for. The rules are based on the Bureau of Customs (BOC) guidelines and other relevant Philippine
                        agencies.
                    </p>

                        1. Determine the parties & whether you qualify for duty/tax privileges. You need to establish
                        who the consignee/done is, and whether the goods are eligible for duty-and/or tax-exemption.
                    </h2>
                    <p>According to the rules:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>If the consignee/donee is a National Government Agency (NGA) → duties and taxes are
                            automatically charged to that agency’s account.</li>
                        <li>If the consignee/donee is a Social Welfare Development Agency (SWDA) that is
                            registered/licensed/accredited under Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) →
                            duty-exempt (if procedures followed), but not tax-exempt in many cases.</li>
                        <li>If the consignee is a foreign embassy or an international organization / specialized agency
                            → duty and tax exempt (if proper procedures followed).</li>
                        <li>If the consignee does not fall into those categories (or does not donate to an eligible
                            donee) → then the goods may not qualify for any duty/tax exemption and will be treated as a
                            normal import.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Practical tip:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>As your company handles customs brokerage, ensure your client (the donee/consignee) is
                            properly registered/accredited (if a non‐government org) and you check that the shipment is
                            being made to that entity. Mistakes in naming the consignee can result in loss of exemption.

                        2. Confirm the type of goods and whether they are regulated or prohibited even if the consignee
                        qualifies, the goods themselves must meet certain conditions:

                        <li>The goods must not be on the list of prohibited imports (e.g., used clothing is absolutely

                        <li>If the goods are regulated or restricted (for example: medicines, medical devices, food
                            items, telecommunication equipment, etc.), the consignee must obtain an Import Permit or
                            Clearance from the relevant Philippine government agency (e.g., Food and Drug Administration
                            for medicines/medical devices) prior to import.</li>
                        <li>The goods must be suitable for import – e.g., for medicine: there must be English
                            translation on labels; expiry date must be at least six (6) months upon arrival; the product
                            must be registered in the country of origin or Philippine equivalent.</li>

                        <li>A. For your customs brokerage, if the donated goods are in a regulated category (medical
                            relief, food supplies, etc.), check upfront for the clearance or permit. If not obtained,
                            the shipment can be delayed or seized.</li>

                        C. Arrival at port / One-Stop Shop & Submission of Documents
                    </h2>
                    <p>When the goods arrive in the Philippines at the port/airport, specific documents must be
                        submitted and processes followed:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Consularised Deed of Donation</li>
                        <li>Deed of Acceptance</li>
                        <li>Bill of Lading (sea freight) or Airway Bill (air freight) endorsed by the shipping
                            agent/airline</li>
                        <li>Itemized Packing List (for example, medicines include lot number and expiry date)</li>
                        <li>Invoice (for calculation of duties/taxes) – even though donation, the invoice may still be
                            required for valuation.</li>
                        <li>Import Permit or Clearance (if required)</li>
                        <li>Filled-up Informal Import Declaration Entry (IIDE) form (or formal entry if required)</li>
                        <li>If sea freight: Permit to Deliver Imported Goods (PDIG) form as required.</li>
                        <li>If the OSS (One‐Stop Shop) is activated (for relief goods, etc.), the relevant government
                            agencies and BOC coordinate at the OSS to expedite release.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Practical tip:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Because your company is a customs brokerage with 20 employees, you should map out standard
                            document checklists for donation shipments. Also anticipate delays because of regulated
                            items.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The BOC examines/appraises the goods. If the goods are prohibited, or regulated goods
                            without permit/clearance, they may be seized and forfeited.</li>
                        <li>If consignee is NGA: duties & taxes charged to NGA account; donor/consignee need not pay.
                        </li>
                        <li>If consignee is SWDA: must secure an indorsement/approval (often from DOF) for duty
                            exemption. Note: tax may still apply (e.g., VAT) depending on case.</li>
                        <li>Even when duty‐exempt, other charges (storage, demurrage, arrastre, trucking, wharfage,
                            stripping/stuffing) are not exempt and must be paid by consignee/agent.</li>
                        <li>Once all is settled and clearance is granted, the goods are released.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>As a customs broker, remind your client that exemptions don’t cover port handling or
                            demurrage charges. Ensure those are clarified in advance. Also track that all required
                            letters/endorsements (DOF, DSWD) are obtained so release isn’t delayed.</li>

                        <li>If goods were regulated (e.g., medicines), the donee/consignee must ensure proper
                            distribution/use (not commercial resale), and proper shelf‐life/expiry compliance.</li>
                        <li>If the donation is to a non-profit educational institution or other charity, the donee may
                            need to submit a distribution plan or a letter of undertaking that the goods will be used
                            exclusively for the charitable purpose and not for resale.</li>
                        <li>Keep records: the Deed of Donation, Acceptance, clearance letters, invoices, packing lists
                            etc. These may be subject to audit.</li>
                        <li>Confirm whether VAT (Value Added Tax) is still applicable despite duty exemption. Some
                            guidelines stress that just because duty is waived doesn’t mean VAT is waived.</li>
