                    <p>Pinoy Pride Worldwide LLC is also willing to assist our fellow Filipinos who wish to donate goods
                        to any foundation or organization in the Philippines for tax-free entry.</p>
                    <p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to importing donated goods into the Philippines (for either
                        humanitarian, charitable, or non-profit purposes). Because you are active in importation (via
                        your customs brokerage company), I’ll also highlight practical points you’ll want to watch out
                        for. The rules are based on the Bureau of Customs (BOC) guidelines and other relevant Philippine
                        agencies.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Step 1 -->

                        1. Determine the parties & whether you qualify for duty/tax privileges. You need to establish
                        who the consignee/done is, and whether the goods are eligible for duty-and/or tax-exemption.
                    </h2>
                    <p>According to the rules:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>If the consignee/donee is a National Government Agency (NGA) → duties and taxes are
                            automatically charged to that agency’s account.</li>
                        <li>If the consignee/donee is a Social Welfare Development Agency (SWDA) that is
                            registered/licensed/accredited under Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) →
                            duty-exempt (if procedures followed), but not tax-exempt in many cases.</li>
                        <li>If the consignee is a foreign embassy or an international organization / specialized agency
                            → duty and tax exempt (if proper procedures followed).</li>
                        <li>If the consignee does not fall into those categories (or does not donate to an eligible
                            donee) → then the goods may not qualify for any duty/tax exemption and will be treated as a
                            normal import.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Practical tip:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>As your company handles customs brokerage, ensure your client (the donee/consignee) is
                            properly registered/accredited (if a non‐government org) and you check that the shipment is
                            being made to that entity. Mistakes in naming the consignee can result in loss of exemption.
                        </li>

                        2. Confirm the type of goods and whether they are regulated or prohibited even if the consignee
                        qualifies, the goods themselves must meet certain conditions:
                    </h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The goods must not be on the list of prohibited imports (e.g., used clothing is absolutely
                            prohibited for donation imports).</li>
                        <li>If the goods are regulated or restricted (for example: medicines, medical devices, food
                            items, telecommunication equipment, etc.), the consignee must obtain an Import Permit or
                            Clearance from the relevant Philippine government agency (e.g., Food and Drug Administration
                            for medicines/medical devices) prior to import.</li>
                        <li>The goods must be suitable for import – e.g., for medicine: there must be English
                            translation on labels; expiry date must be at least six (6) months upon arrival; the product
                            must be registered in the country of origin or Philippine equivalent.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>A. For your customs brokerage, if the donated goods are in a regulated category (medical
                            relief, food supplies, etc.), check upfront for the clearance or permit. If not obtained,
                            the shipment can be delayed or seized.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Before the goods arrive (or as they arrive) certain documentation must be completed. The general

                        <li>The sender (donor abroad) advises the consignee in the Philippines that the donation is
                            forthcoming and that the consignee is willing and prepared to receive it.</li>
                        <li>The donor prepares a Deed of Donation (also called “Deed of Donation”) addressed to the
                            consignee/donee. This must be consularized (authenticated) by the Philippine consulate or
                            embassy in the donor’s country.</li>
                        <li>The consignee executes a Deed of Acceptance of the donation from the donor.</li>
                        <li>If the goods are restricted/regulated, the consignee obtains the required import
                            permit/clearance. (As mentioned already)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Have your brokerage checklist include verification of the Deed of Donation (and
                            consularisation) and Deed of Acceptance. Without those, duties/taxes exemption may not
                            apply.</li>
                    </ul>

                        submitted and processes followed:</p>

                        <li>Invoice (for calculation of duties/taxes) – even though donation, the invoice may still be
                            required for valuation.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Because your company is a customs brokerage with 20 employees, you should map out standard
                            document checklists for donation shipments. Also anticipate delays because of regulated
                            items.</li>

                        <li>The BOC examines/appraises the goods. If the goods are prohibited, or regulated goods

                        <li>If consignee is NGA: duties & taxes charged to NGA account; donor/consignee need not pay.

                        <li>Even when duty‐exempt, other charges (storage, demurrage, arrastre, trucking, wharfage,

                            letters/endorsements (DOF, DSWD) are obtained so release isn’t delayed.</li>

                        <li>If the donation is to a non-profit educational institution or other charity, the donee may
                            need to submit a distribution plan or a letter of undertaking that the goods will be used
                            exclusively for the charitable purpose and not for resale.</li>
                        <li>Keep records: the Deed of Donation, Acceptance, clearance letters, invoices, packing lists
                            etc. These may be subject to audit.</li>
                        <li>Confirm whether VAT (Value Added Tax) is still applicable despite duty exemption. Some
