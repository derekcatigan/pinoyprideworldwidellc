                        It is well known globally that one of the most stable and profitable ways to earn a sustainable
                        income is through business—especially when it aligns with one’s passion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Among the most recognized and essential types of businesses worldwide are grocery stores, as
                        people rely on their products every single day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also understand that most, if not all, grocery store owners strive to offer lower prices than
                        their competitors. However, many are unaware of how to <strong>purchase directly from
                            factories</strong>, which forces them to buy from importers, even those located in distant
                        states.

                                All factories or manufacturers that already market their products in the USA typically
                                have an Export License, which is one of the key requirements to export their goods.
                                (If the factory does not have one, we can use the Export License of our Logistics or

                                straightforward.

                                Since grocery items include food products, an FDA Certificate or License is also

                                Fortunately, applying for an FDA Certificate in the USA is also a simple and manageable
                                process.

                                allow you to compute your total landed cost per product, giving you a clear picture of
